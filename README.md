### Namaste :pray: 

I'm Alok and I have 20+ years of rich experience in attaining detailed software products. Top-performer and motivator who has the added advantage of technology as leverage to achieve timely results. I do possess a good technical knowledge of Angular, and functional knowledge of retail lending (banks & NBFCs) and master data management domains. My skills include a strategic planner, skillful at identifying customer needs, utilizing technology-driven solutions and formulating strategic road-maps. I burn calories and oxygenate my brain, by taking an hour walk in the morning, giving me a release before a day of stress. Over the weekends I pack the sandwiches or pull whatever I have out of the refrigerator, and then go find a scenic picnic place to create wonderful memories with my family and friends.
